McKnight's thesis is that institutions are structurally unsuited to collaborative support.
I would argue he's even saying that large structures like sprawling non-profits or the federal government are permanently divorced from the unique needs of Americans. 
While his analysis of assocations is relevant and useful, I believe he ties his argument too strongly to associations as a messianic force. His citations of Alexis de Tocqueville lend this piece an air of longing for some great, missing, American democracy. 
Rather than rejecting the idea of American decline, he embraces themes of rejuvenation and a return to true democratic values. 
His assocation with the Kettering Institute, a think tank working to "make democracy work as it should."
This attitude seems nationalistic, appealing to a sense of American exceptionalism. 

I would argue large institutions are necessary for the production and distribution of resources like medicine and, as well as large infrastructure projects. 
These are needs felt most immediately by marginalized groups without either the individual capital to participate in larger extractive systems (buying expensive medicines from pharma companies) or the collective empowerment to service their own community needs (shared transportation, community distribution of food). 

To build such associations requires other forms of capital (cultural, social, financial), and oppressed groups have these taken from them. 
To actually implement some Great American Democracy in every community would first require the righting of the wrongs of segregation, pollution, redlining, and oppressive policing. 

Apart from these critiques, I believe McKnight's piece provides a useful classification of associations, and does a lot of work to critique alienating organizations and forms of production.
I'll likely use this piece to define associations and fit my internship experience in that framework.
