key functionality:
    automatic sending of emails at certain time without cancellation

big decisions:
    reliability is an issue, so probably best to do this from a server, not user's machine
    we can do both though
    
    probably do it in python? there can be a frontend in electron or something 
    
    server and user can use same core python utils for timer, sending, etc

    need to make requests from the user to the server, probably use encryption or else MITM

python libraries needed:
    emails
        gmail: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes  send-only
        support for local mail clients?
        support for other webmail?
    timer
        datetime
    https requests (need tcp to ensure our request is received)
        httplib
    

we'll need to log in to the user's email acc, so they should be able to provide their details
also provide links to sign up for email acc

assumptions:
    no timezone weirdness
    user's machine has correct time and will always have correct time

frontend:
    electron
    

there's a question of python vs js:
    electron runs in all nodejs, so i could just do all of the stuff i need in nodejs instead of python
    then i wouldn't need to do ipc between the server and the frontend when its running on their local machine. 
    it would also be cleaner, prettier, and easier to use.

k so i need a node.js alternative for all of my functionality.

nodejs libraries needed:
    emails
        gmail: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/auth/scopes  send-only
        same as python
    timer
        Date()
        getime()
    https requests (need tcp to ensure our request is received)
        express
        
i think the server itself is fine just in python, with an electron client that talks to it.

write the server first to avoid frontend work and lay down the core functionality.
