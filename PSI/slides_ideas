i want ppl to come out of it feeling like they have more knowledge of their vulnerability to government surveillance
in the end this won't be super empowering probably, but the stuff that /is/ empowering will be like mathematically certain
so open with examples of how we are all powerless

    certificate authorities make all https useless
    unreliable ecc curves?
    advanced side-channel attacks like freezing ram, rowhammer, timing, tempest
    
    maybe talk about hard-to-mitigate vulns like rowhammer to show the depth of issues
    
maybe talk about historical examples? 
    eff and DES
    history of classified crypto: ibm differential analysis

wide net and threat modeling
    international bit 
    apple in china
    five eyes

strategies to counter wide net surveillance?

so what can we do?
talk about modern tools that are easily usable
    
    tails
    signal (maybe brief aside to talk about what's sus about it)
    tor

    

---

figure out what we'll need to actually run this

how long should it be?

how many people will we need for lecturing?

how many people will we need for the pgp workshop?

what materials will we need? thumb drives for private keys? something else? do we talk about linux or do we stick with windows?
