i want ppl to come out of it feeling like they have more knowledge of their vulnerability to government surveillance
in the end this won't be super empowering probably, but the stuff that /is/ empowering will be like mathematically certain
so open with examples of how we are all powerless

    certificate authorities make all https useless
    need vulnerabilities and gov. backdoors at all levels, so look for hardware stuff
    unreliable ecc curves?
    if there isn't a backdoor, there's a way through it (backdoor would be owning a cert authority, way around it would be classified crpyto breaking strategies)
    
    maybe talk about hard-to-mitigate vulns like rowhammer to show the depth of issues
    

maybe talk about historical examples? eff and DES, history of classified crypto/big iron

segue to how they need really big computers to break crypto because it's reliant on mathematics, instead of trust in any central authority
talk about modern examples of "good crypto" that are easily usable
    
    full disk encryption?
    pgp obviously 
    signal (maybe brief aside to talk about what's sus about it)
    maybe more? i wanna keep it to actually useful things that are easy to download and use

end with pgp workshop getting everyone set up with a public and private key pair

---

figure out what we'll need to actually run this

how long should it be?

how many people will we need for lecturing?

how many people will we need for the pgp workshop?

what materials will we need? thumb drives for private keys? something else? do we talk about linux or do we stick with windows?
