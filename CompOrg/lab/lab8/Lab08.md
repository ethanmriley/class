## Basic boolean gates

[lab08.zip](https://www.evernote.com/l/AAKZUvyN2xBJVrXjPf081E8Ef0yrOgKErJw) contains all of the starter template code for constructing your programs.
Implement the functions `and_gate()` and `xor_gate()`.

## Slightly more advanced

Implement the functions `multiplexer()` and `decoder()` to perform the appropriate actions.

## SR latch in software

Implement an SR latch in software.
The [Wikipedia Flip Flop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#SR_NOR_latch) page contains more detail on SR latches.
