# Matrix Multiplication

## Due Date: Monday, March 5th, 11:59:59 PM

In this assignment we will be using the SPIM simulator that you installed in lab.
Your task will be to implement a matrix multiplication algorithm in MIPS assembly.
Your code only needs to support a 4 $\times$ 4 matrix.
Only unsigned integer values need to be supported.

Since we have not covered multiplication yet, a function has been provided to you.
It is referenced specifically in the pseudocode but that is not the only location where it is appropriate to call it.

Below is some sample output.
Note that your program should match these samples exactly.
Printing the tab character is often enough to achieve acceptable spacing.
The starter code can be found in the Resources section on Piazza.
